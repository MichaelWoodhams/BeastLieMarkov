# BeastLieMarkov
Beast 2 plugin implementing the distingished pair Lie Markov models of DNA evolution

For a description and discussion of the models see the paper (http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1525) 
"A new hierarchy of phylogenetic models consistent with heterogeneous substitution rates"
by Michael D. Woodhams, Jesús Fernández-Sánchez, Jeremy G. Sumner. (At time of writing, this is 
submitted to a peer reviewed journal.)

As well as being a Beast2 plugin, this is intended as a reference implementation of the Lie Markov models. 
Feel free to cut and paste code (LGPL v2.1) or to use this as a guide/comparison to your own implementation.
